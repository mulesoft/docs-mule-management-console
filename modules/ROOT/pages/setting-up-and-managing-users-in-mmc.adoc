The page takes you through the basics of setting up users via the Management Console. Refer to xref:managing-mmc-users-and-roles.adoc[Managing MMC Users and Roles] for information on setting user groups and assigning permissions.

[NOTE]
This page describes adding and managing users via the Management Console. You can also add and manage users using LDAP, but note that once you enable authentication through LDAP, the *User* link is no longer available in the Management Console. See xref:setting-up-and-managing-users-via-ldap.adoc[Setting Up and Managing Users via LDAP] for more information.

== Assumptions

This document assumes you are an Administrator account holder in MMC.

== Adding New Users and Adding Them to User Groups

. On the Administration tab, click *Users* in the Manage section of the navigation tree on the left. The pane lists all current console users. Click the *New* button(circled in the figure below) to create a new user.

. Select at least one group from the *Available Groups* list. The new user will be added to the groups you select. Keep in mind that once the user joins a group, that user has the permissions granted to that group or groups. Use the right angle bracket (>) to move the selected role to *Joined Groups*.
+
[NOTE]
The default groups are Administrators, Deployers, Monitors, and Server Administrators. If you need to create more groups or roles, see xref:managing-mmc-users-and-roles.adoc[Managing MMC Users and Roles].

. Click *Save*.

== Editing Users

. On the Administration tab, click *Users*, and then click the username of the user you want to edit.
. Edit the user's name or email address if needed.
. If you need to reset the user's password, click *Reset Password*, enter the new password twice, and then click OK.
. To assign the user to a group, select the group in the Available Group list and click *>* so that the group appears in Joined Groups. To remove the user from a group, select the group in the Joined Groups list and click *<*.
. When you have finished editing this user, click *Save*.

== Deleting Users

. On the Administration tab, click *Users*, and then click the user name of the user you want to delete.
. Click the *Delete* button at the bottom of the Edit User screen.
