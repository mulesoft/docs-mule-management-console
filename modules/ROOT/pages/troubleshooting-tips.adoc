[WARNING]
Mule Management Console (MMC) was deprecated in December 2015. Its https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#mule-management-console[End of Life] is July 15, 2019. For more information see the xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mmc-migrator-tool.adoc[MMC Migrator Tool] or contact your Customer Success Manager to determine how you can migrate to Anypoint Runtime Manager.

This page covers various troubleshooting topics, such as help for troubleshooting a problematic installation.

== Unable to Register the Console Agent

When running Mule ESB server and the console in a Tomcat environment you may have a problem registering the Mule server instance with the console agent. This problem occurs when you try to register the server through the console screen. After entering the server name and the URL for the Mule agent, the console displays a message indicating that the console could not register the Mule server you specified, and that the server host system did not send a valid HTTP response. This problem usually occurs if you had previously unregistered the same server instance, but for some reason the unregistration process did not complete properly. There may be other reasons why the Mule server instance may internally be still registered.

When this occurs, you need to do the following to fix the problem:

* Delete the `truststore.jks` file from the `<MULE_HOME>/.mule/.agent` directory. It is not necessary to stop the Mule server to delete this file.

== Unable to Register Server

Getting this exception when trying to register Mule Server using MMC
`Could not register server <serverName>: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target`

*Solution*: Try deleting `truststore.jks` from the `<MULE_HOME>/.mule/.agent` folder, or delete the `.mule/.agent` folder completely. It is not necessary to stop the Mule server to delete this file.

== Using a Custom Agent Configuration

You may want to configure a different default port for agent communication, or a different server ID before running Mule.

You can change the agent configuration from that of the default URL, which is displayed when registering a new server instance. The agent configuration determines the bind port for the server instance. You may wish to change the agent URL if you want to start multiple instances of Mule ESB within the same box and connect the console to these different instances, or if you want to connect to remote server instances.

Unless a port is specified, the console will look in the 7777-7877 port range and bind to the first free port by default. When you start Mule from a command line, you can change the port to which the server binds. You specify the new port as a switch or option in the command used to start Mule, as follows:

[source,text,linenums]
----
-M-Dmule.mmc.bind.port=7773
----

For example:

[source,text,linenums]
----
/opt/mule/3.6.0/bin/mule start -M-Dmule.mmc.bind.port=7773
----

You may also specify a custom port range, as follows:

[source,text,linenums]
----
-M-Dmule.mmc.bind.port=7783-7883
----

This will force the agent to bind on the first available port starting from 7783 until 7883.

You can also specify these arguments in the `wrapper.conf` file. For organizations with strict policies on available ports, this option should be used.

In addition, when you change the agent bind port to accommodate multiple Mule instances, you also must start Mule from the `bin` directory that corresponds to the particular Mule instance. For example, you might run a second instance of Mule as follows, where this second instance is installed at `/opt/second_mule`:

[source,text,linenums]
----
/opt/second_mule/bin/mule start -M-Dmule.mmc.bind.port=7773
----

== Starting Multiple Mule Agent Instances

You can start more than one Mule agent instance, but you have to bind each agent to its own port and start a separate listener for each agent.

For example, if you start two Mule agent instances, one instance uses the default bind port of 7777, as described in the above section. For the second agent instance, you set up the port to which the agent binds as port 7778. You also must specify a listener class for this second agent instance. Add the following code to the `web.xml` file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>mule.mmc.bind.port</param-name>
<param-value>7778</param-value>
        <description>MMC agent bind port</description>
</context-param>

<listener>
   <listener-class>com.mulesoft.mmc.agent.web.MmcAwareContextListener</listener-class>
</listener>
----

[WARNING]
If you are using MMC listener-class, remove org.mule.config.builders.MuleXmlBuilderContextListener listener-class, because both listeners will try to start the same mule instance.

Note that the same two properties, the bind port and listener class, are supported for standalone Mule ESB servers and those servers configured via the `web.xml` file.

== Support for MMC When Used with Tcat

For the management console to work with a Tcat server, you need to modify the value of the variable `PermGenSize` from 128 to 256. You should increase the size of `PermGenSize` to 256 before you deploy the management console WAR file to Tcat. After modifying `PermGenSize`, start Tcat and then deploy the management console WAR file. Both Tcat and the management console should now work together with no problems.

If after changing `PermGenSize` and starting Tcat, you get an `OutOfMemoryError` message when deploying the console WAR file, then you need to take the following steps. These steps walk you through registering the Tcat local agent, deploying the management console WAR file, logging into the console and registering the console agent.

* Install Tcat version 6.2.1 or greater.

Edit the batch file for starting Tcat, `catalina.bat`. You want to move the line referencing `JAVA_OPTS` at the top of the file to line 126 in the file. Then, change the setting for `PermGenSize`within that line from 126m to 256m. When you're done, line 126 should look as follows:

[source,text,linenums]
----
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dgalaxy.data="%CATALINA_BASE%\galaxy-data" -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
----

* Start Tcat.
* Log into Tcat and register the local Tcat agent. Use this URL for the agent (eg. http://localhost:7777/agent).
* Create a new package that contains the mmc war file and the Local Tcat Agent.
* Click the Save and Deploy buttons.
* Click the Local Tcat Agent Servers link.
* Click the Applications tab.
* Click the Go To link.
* Log into the Mule management console and start a local Mule ESB instance on which the console agent has been deployed.
* Click the New Server button in the console and register the console agent using its URL (eg. http://localhost:7777/mmc-support).

=== Configuring a Custom Folder for mmc-data

To specify a new folder for `mmc-data`, use the following parameter in the Mule startup command:

[source,text,linenums]
----
-M-Dmmc.data=<path>
----

For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<MULE_HOME>/bin/mule start -M-Dmmc.data=/opt/mule/3.6.0/data/mmc-data
----

=== Disabling the Management Console Agent at Startup

To disable the Management Console agent on Mule ESB startup, use the `mule.agent.enabled` property as shown below.

[source,text,linenums]
----
-M-Dmule.agent.enabled=false
----

The agent is enabled by default.
