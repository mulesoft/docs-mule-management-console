= Get a Server Group
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

When called with the HTTP GET operation, the resource `/mmc/api/serverGroups/<serverGroupId>` returns a single server group with the specified ID. You need to substitute the id of the server group for `<serverGroupId>`.

There are two ways to obtain the URL of a server from the server group:

* Use the `href` property of the server when you get a list of servers.
* Use the `redirectOnResult` query parameter to look up a server by its name.

[WARNING]
Using the `redirectOnResult` parameter allows you to effectively do a GET on a server without knowing the server object ID. This parameter works as follows. When `redirectOnResult` is enabled, the expected result should be only one object. Your client receives an HTTP redirect to that single object and the final response is the JSON description of just that one object. Thus, using `redirectOnResult` removes both the need to test for the case of a single matching object and issuing a second REST API request to retrieve the object.

== Example Request

The following is an example of calling this resource.

`+GET http://localhost:8080/mmc/api/serverGroups/73d89173-290e-4cb3-a61c-e11deb74767d+`

== Example Response

The previous request might return a response such as shown below:
