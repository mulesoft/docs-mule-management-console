== Overview

MuleSoft has released MMC 3.4.2, it is available as a .war file for deploying to a Web application server.

There are currently two different .war files available:

* `mmc-console-3.4.2.war`
* `mmc-console-sqlserver-3.4.2.war`

The file `mmc-console-3.4.2.war` allows you to persist MMC environment and transaction data on MMC's internal databases (the default) or on any supported external database _except_ MS-SQL Server.

The file `mmc-console-sqlserver-3.4.2.war` allows you to persist MMC environment and transaction data on MMC's internal databases (the default) or on any supported external database _including_ MS-SQL Server.

Please carefully read this page to determine the correct version that you need to download and configure.

== Migrating Data from Older Versions of MMC

To successfully upgrade to MMC 3.4.2 from an older version, you will need to migrate data from your old MMC installation in the following scenarios:

* If the old version of MMC uses LDAP for user authentication
* If the old version of MMC persists environment or tracking data to an external databases

In both of the above cases, you need to migrate configuration data in order to retain your settings.

If your current MMC installation does not use LDAP for user authentication and is not configured to persist data on an external database, then you do not need to take further actions for upgrading to MMC 3.4.2.

The following documentation pages provide the steps necessary to migrate data to MMC 3.4.2:
