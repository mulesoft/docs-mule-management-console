Depending on the chart you select, you may be queried for more information. For example, if you select the Flow Execution Time chart, you are prompted to select a flow from the pull-down list. You can also customize the display name for the chart. See the figure below.

== Chart Configuration Options

You can add the following server metrics charts. For each type of chart, the table shows the configuration you will need to specify. Since you may configure the display name for any chart type, this option is not shown in the table. In addition, you can add the server metrics chart to all servers.
