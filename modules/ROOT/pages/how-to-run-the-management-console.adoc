To run the Management Console, make sure your web container is running and the Management Console webapp has been deployed correctly.

If you are using the evaluation version, enter `+http://localhost:8585/mmc+` in your browser.

Note: If you have deployed a production version rather than the evaluation version, enter `http://localhost:8080/mmc` in your browser.

Note: This note pertains only to those users deploying to a TCat server and relying on default values. You should specify the URL to be the exact name of the Management Console `war` file you deployed to the web container, since the `mmc` portion of the URL references the deployed agent per the `war` file. For example, if you deployed a `war` file with the name `mmc-server-3.2.-SNAPSHOT`, you would specify the URL as `http://localhost:8080/mc-server-3.2-SNAPSHOT` rather than `http://localhost:8080/mmc`.

The login screen (see below) appears in the browser window, indicating you have started the Management Console.

If another app is using port 8585 (or 8080), you can change the port in your container's configuration (such as the `/conf/server.xml` file under your TomCat home directory). If you want to run the Management Console remotely from another computer, enter the correct name (op IP address) of the host computer instead of localhost.

When you start the Management Console for the first time, you can log in with the user name "admin" ad the password "admin".
