= Managing Deployments Using REST APIs
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

The management console provides REST APIs that you can use to programmatically access much of the console's functionality. Among the operations that you can request with the REST APIs are operations related to managing deployments. This includes deploying, undeploying, creating, updating, and deleting deployments inside a server or cluster.

[NOTE]
See xref:using-the-management-console-api.adoc[Using the Management Console APIs] for an overview of the REST APIs, including a basic example of use, and a summary of returned status codes and error handling codes.


This page provides a brief description of each REST API for managing deployments, an HTTP method to invoke the API, and a usage example. The examples show how to invoke the API using http://curl.haxx.se/[cURL], the command line HTTP tool.

Note: The notation \{mmc base} refers to the console base address. The console base address used in the examples is http://localhost:8080/mmc and configured with the default username and password (admin:admin).

The table below summarizes the REST APIs for managing deployments:
