= Encrypting the MMC LDAP Password
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

*_Enterprise Edition_*

By default, the Management Console, when configured to xref:setting-up-and-managing-users-via-ldap.adoc[use LDAP for user authentication], stores unencrypted LDAP credentials in plain text configuration files. To avoid this security risk, you can configure the Management Console to store encrypted LDAP passwords, and to decrypt them using the http://www.jasypt.org/download.html[Jasypt] encryption library.

Implementing this configuration entails the following tasks:

* <<Downloading And Installing the Encryption Library>>
* <<Encrypting the Password>>
* <<Configuring the Management Console>>

You encrypt the password using Jasypt, and provide the encrypted value and other parameters to the Management Console. On user authentication, the Management Console will use Jasypt to decrypt the user password.

[TIP]
If you wish to encrypt user passwords, but do not use LDAP for user authentication, see xref:encrypting-mmc-user-passwords.adoc[Encrypting MMC User Passwords].

[TIP]
The configuration described in this page stores decryption parameters in Management Console configuration files. An attacker with access to these files could decrypt the user password using these parameters. To avoid this security risk, you can integrate Jasypt with Spring 3.0 and store decryption parameters as environment variables. For details, see http://www.jasypt.org/springsecurity.html[integrating Jasypt with Spring 3.0].

== Downloading And Installing the Encryption Library

http://www.jasypt.org/download.html[Jasypt] is an easy-to-use Java library that provides basic encryption capabilities. It is free software, licensed under the http://www.jasypt.org/license.html[Apache Software License].

To install Jasypt in the Management Console, complete the following steps:

. Download the latest version (currently 1.9.0) from Jasypt's http://www.jasypt.org/download.html[download page]. Jasypt downloads as a .zip file called `jasypt-1.9.0-dist.zip`.
. Unzip the file `jasypt-1.9.0-dist.zip`, which expands to the directory `jasypt-1.9.0`.
. Copy the files  `jasypt-1.9.0.jar` and `jasypt-spring3-1.9.0.jar` to the directory `<MMC installation path>/WEB-INF/lib`. You will find these files in the `jasypt-1.9.0/lib` directory.

== Encrypting the Password

To encrypt a password, run the script `encrypt.sh` (or `encrypt.bat` if on a Windows system). You can find the script in the `bin` subdirectory of the `jasypt-1.9.0` directory.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<path to file>/encrypt.sh input="valueToEncrypt" password=MYPASS algorithm=PBEWithMD5AndDES
----

[%header,cols="15,75"]
|===
|Script parameter |Description
|`input` |The value to encrypt. This is the actual LDAP password you wish to encrypt.
|`password` |The string used for encrypting `input`. This is not the LDAP password, but the phrase used to encrypt the password. The password itself is provided in the `input` parameter.
|`algorithm` |The algorithm to use for encryption.
|===

The script shows the encrypted password on standard output, as shown in the example below.

Note that if on a Unix or Unix-based system, you need to set execute permissions for `encrypt.sh` to be able to run it.

[TIP]
====
*How to apply execute permissions on Unix systems*

To set execute permissions for the `encrypt.sh` script, run the following command:

[source,text,linenums]
----
chmod a+x <path to file>encrypt.sh
----

For example:

[source,text,linenums]
----
chmod a+x /home/mary/jasypt-1.9.0/bin/encrypt.sh
----

This command adds execute permission for all users (file owner, file owner's group, and other users).
====

Copy the encrypted output and store it in a convenient location, such as a text file of your choosing. You will need to copy this value to the `mmc-ldap.properties` file, as detailed in the <<File mmc-ldap.properties>> section.

For more information about `encrypt.sh`, including other usage samples, see Jasypt's http://www.jasypt.org/cli.html[CLI Tools] page.

== Configuring the Management Console

=== File applicationContext.ldap.xml

Locate the file `<MMC Home>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/applicationContext.ldap.xml`, then add to it the bean listed below. Note that this bean must be the first bean in the file.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="propertyConfigurer" class="org.jasypt.spring3.properties.EncryptablePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
    <constructor-arg ref="configurationEncryptor" />
    <property name="locations">
      <list>
          <value>/WEB-INF/classes/mmc-ldap.properties</value>
      </list>
   </property>
   <property name="ignoreUnresolvablePlaceholders" value="true"/>
</bean>
----

=== File ldap.xml

Locate the file `<MMC Home>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/ldap.xml`, then add to it the beans listed below. Note that the value for property `password` must be the same you gave to the `encrypt.sh` script as the `password` parameter. In the example provided in the <<Encrypting the Password>> section, the value is `MYPASS`.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<bean id="encryptorConfig" class="org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.config.SimplePBEConfig">
    <property name="algorithm" value="PBEWithMD5AndDES" />
    <property name="password" value="MYPASS" />
 </bean>
  <bean id="configurationEncryptor" class="org.jasypt.encryption.pbe.StandardPBEStringEncryptor">
    <property name="config" ref="encryptorConfig" />
</bean>
----

=== File mmc-ldap.properties

Locate the file `<MMC Home>/apps/mmc/webapps/mmc/WEB-INF/classes/mmc-ldap.properties`. Edit this file to include the output of the `encrypt.sh` script as the value of the `password` parameter, as shown below.

[source,text,linenums]
----
password=ENC(NdPn1skzduJFjGaIOY53pMALTgped0zX)
----

Note that the encrypted value is surrounded by `ENC()`. This indicates that the value is encrypted, and must be processed by the Jasypt library while Spring constructs the bean.

The `mmc-ldap.properties` file will be similar to the code shown below.

[source,text,linenums]
----
providerURL=ldaps://192.168.1.14:636/
userDn=cn=sb,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
password=ENC(NdPn1skzduJFjGaIOY53pMALTgped0zX)
usernameAttribute=cn
userSearchBaseContext=ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
userSearchFilterExpression=(cn={0})
userSearchBase=ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
userSearchAttributeKey=objectclass
userSearchAttributeValue=person
roleDn=ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
groupSearchFilter=(uniqueMember={0})
----

After completing the preceding steps, restart the Management Console for the changes to take effect.

[TIP]
To avoid storing the passphrase on the Management Console configuration files, you can integrate Jasypt with Spring 3.0 and store decryption parameters as environment variables. For details, see http://www.jasypt.org/springsecurity.html[integrating Jasypt with Spring 3.0].
