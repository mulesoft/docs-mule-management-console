Click the Applications tab to see information about applications on the server. You can start, restart, and stop applications listed here. Applications that are currently running appear with a green circle to the left of the application name. Check the application(s) and then click the appropriate Start, Restart, or Stop button. See the figure below. Note that you cannot start, stop, or restart the Agent application (highlighted below) because it is a privileged application.
