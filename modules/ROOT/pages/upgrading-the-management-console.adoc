*_*MMC Version 3.5.0*_*

MMC agent and .war files are available through the http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[MuleSoft Customer Portal]. It is strongly recommended to upgrade to the latest version of MMC.

[NOTE]
Starting with Mule ESB 3.4.0, the MMC agent comes bundled with the Mule ESB Enterprise runtime download.

== Overview

The easiest, and recommended way of upgrading to MMC 3.5.0 is to do a clean install. Doing a clean install saves you from following the migration path according to your current MMC version.

If you don't have the option of performing a clean install, the steps required to upgrade to MMC 3.5.0 depend on your current MMC version.

MMC 3.4.2 introduced a new, simplified configuration for persisting data on external databases and for managing users via LDAP. This new configuration is also used by MMC 3.5.0. This means that if your current MMC version is earlier than 3.4.2, and you use an external database for data persistence and/or use LDAP to manage MMC users, you will need to migrate your current configuration to the new config introduced in 3.4.2.

Additionally, if upgrading from MMC 3.4.0 or 3.4.1, you may need to upgrade your MMC agent.

MMC 3.5.0 introduced changes to one of the tables that store Business Events data. Before upgrading to MMC 3.5.0, you will need to run a migration script on the database that persists Business Events data. This does not apply if your current MMC version is 3.4.2 and you persist Business Events data on MS SQL Server.

The table below provides details for each MMC version.

== Determining Your MMC Version

You can determine what version of the MMC .war file  you are currently running by logging into the console and clicking *About Mule ESB Enterprise* at the bottom right of the screen.

[NOTE]
In all cases, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to the newest version of the Management Console.

== Upgrading

This section contains upgrade information relevant for earlier versions of MMC:

* <<MMC 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 to MMC 3.5.0>>
* MMC 3.4.1 Patched for MS SQL Server to MMC 3.5.0
* <<MMC 3.4.2 for MS SQL Server to MMC 3.5.0>>

=== MMC 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 to MMC 3.5.0

If you are upgrading your .war to version 3.5.0, and your Mule ESB version is earlier than 3.4.1, you may need to upgrade your Management Console agent, as described below.

If you are upgrading your .war to version 3.5.0, and your Mule ESB version is 3.4.1 or later, you do not need to upgrade your Management Console Agent.

=== MMC 3.4.1 for MS SQL Server to MMC 3.5.0

MMC 3.4.2 introduced a new and greatly simplified configuration for persisting data on external databases. So in order to upgrade from MMC 3.4.1 to 3.5.0, you need to first migrate your config files to the new format introduced in 3.4.2.

Migrating your config files is described in xref:upgrading-to-mmc-3.5.0-with-an-external-database.adoc[Upgrading to MMC 3.5.0 with an External Database]. The process is the same for upgrading to 3.4.2 and for 3.5.0.

After migrating your config files, you need to run migration scripts on your target MS SQL database. This process is described in xref:upgrading-from-mmc-3.4.1-for-ms-sql-server-to-mmc-3.5.0-for-ms-sql-server.adoc[Upgrading from MMC 3.4.1 for MS-SQL Server to MMC 3.5.0 for MS-SQL Server].

Finally, if you are managing MMC users via LDAP, you need to migrate your MMC LDAP configuration as described in xref:upgrading-to-mmc-3.5.0-with-ldap.adoc[Upgrading to MMC 3.5.0 with LDAP].

The complete sequence of steps is:

. Download MMC 3.5.0.
. Stop your MMC 3.4.1 for MS SQL server.
. In MMC 3.5.0, modify the configuration for external data persistence as described in xref:upgrading-to-mmc-3.5.0-with-an-external-database.adoc[Upgrading to MMC 3.5.0 with an External Database].
. If managing MMC users via LDAP, modify the configuration for LDAP as described in xref:upgrading-to-mmc-3.5.0-with-ldap.adoc[Upgrading to MMC 3.5.0 with LDAP]. If not managing MMC users via LDAP, skip this step.
. On your target database on MS SQL server, run the SQL migration scripts as described in xref:upgrading-from-mmc-3.4.1-for-ms-sql-server-to-mmc-3.5.0-for-ms-sql-server.adoc[Upgrading from MMC 3.4.1 for MS-SQL Server to MMC 3.5.0 for MS-SQL Server].
. Start MMC 3.5.0.

=== MMC 3.4.2 for MS SQL Server to MMC 3.5.0

You need to copy database connection information (database host, user credentials, etc.) from your 3.4.2 to your 3.5.0 installation. For details, see MMC 3.4.2 to 3.5.0 with an External Database.

=== MMC 3.4.2 to MMC 3.5.0

If upgrading from MMC 3.4.2 to 3.5.0, you need to run an SQL migration script on the database used to store Business Events data if one of two conditions are met:

* You are persisting Business Events data on MMC's internal H2 database (the default)
* You are persisting Business Events data on any external database except MS SQL Server

You must run this script before running MMC 3.5.0 for the first time. For instructions and the SQL scripts to run, see xref:migration-scripts-for-business-events.adoc[Migration Scripts for Business Events].

=== MMC 3.4.2 to MMC 3.5.0 with an External Database

MMC 3.4.2 introduced a new configuration for persisting data on external databases. MMC 3.5.0 also uses this configuration, so if upgrading from 3.4.2 to 3.5.0 you do not need to migrate to a new configuration. However, you do need to perform two steps:

. Activate the Spring profile for your external database in `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/web.xml`
. Copy the database connection information (host, user credentials, etc.) to the 3.5.0 installation. To do this, you can copy the file `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/databases/<your_database_file>` from your 3.4.2 installation. The actual name of this file depends on the type of data you are persisting (environment or tracking) and the external database you are using. For example, if persisting environment data to Oracle, the correct file is `mmc-oracle.properties`.

For details on both files, see the following sections.

==== File: `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/web.xml`

This file defines, among other things, the internal or external databases used by MMC uses to store its data. The definition is stored in the `spring.profiles.active` section, whose default value is shown below.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
    <param-value>tracking-h2,env-derby</param-value>
</context-param>
----

To activate a profile for an external database in MMC 3.5.0, you can manually add the value to the section shown above, or copy the entire `web.xml` file from your 3.4.2 installation.

==== File: `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/databases/<type of data>-<database name>.properties`

The type of data can be `mmc` (for MMC environment data) or `tracking-persistence` (for Business Events). The full list of available files is shown below.

[source,text,linenums]
----
mmc-db2.properties
mmc-derby.properties
mmc-mssql.properties
mmc-mysql.properties
mmc-oracle.properties
mmc-postgres.properties
tracking-persistence-db2.properties
tracking-persistence-h2.properties
tracking-persistence-mssql.properties
tracking-persistence-mysql.properties
tracking-persistence-oracle.properties
tracking-persistence-postgres.properties
----

So for example, the file `mmc-oracle.properties` defines the configuration for persisting MMC environment data on an external Oracle database; the file `tracking-persistence-postgres.properties` defines the configuration for persisting Business Events data on an external Postgres database, etc.

You can copy the entire relevant file(s) from MMC 3.4.2 to 3.5.0.

=== MMC 3.4.2 to MMC 3.5.0 Using LDAP

MMC 3.4.2 introduced a new configuration for managing users via LDAP. MMC 3.5.0 also uses this configuration, so if upgrading from 3.4.2 to 3.5.0 you do not need to migrate to a new configuration. However, you do need to perform two steps:

. Activate the LDAP Spring profile in `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/web.xml`
. Copy the LDAP connection information (LDAP host, MMC credentials, etc.) to the 3.5.0 installation. To do this, you can copy the file `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/mmc-ldap.properties` from your 3.4.2 installation

Details about the LDAP configuration are provided below.

==== File: `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/web.xml`

This file defines, among other things, whether the LDAP profile is active or not. The definition is stored in the `spring.profiles.active` section, as shown below.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<context-param>
...
    <param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
    <param-value>tracking-h2,env-derby,ldap</param-value>
</context-param>
----

You can manually add the `ldap` parameter to this file in MMC 3.5.0, or copy the entire file from MMC 3.4.2 to 3.5.0.

==== File: `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/mmc-ldap.properties`

This is the LDAP configuration file for MMC. It is divided by sections such as `LDAP CONNECTION`, `MMC AUTHENTICATION`, etc. and contains extensive comments. When upgrading from MMC 3.4.2 to 3.5.0, you can simply copy the file from 3.4.2 to 3.5.0.
