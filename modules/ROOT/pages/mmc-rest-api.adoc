The management console provides REST APIs that you can use to programmatically access much of the console's functionality. Using these REST APIs, you can:

* Register new servers and manage existing servers, including restarting servers.
* Manage server groups.
* Access and manage files on servers.

== Assumptions

This section assumes that you have a clear picture of the
xref:architecture-of-the-mule-management-console.adoc[Architecture of the Mule Management Console] and xref:installing-mmc.adoc[installed MMC]
