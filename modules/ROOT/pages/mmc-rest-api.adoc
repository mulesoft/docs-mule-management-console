The management console provides REST APIs that you can use to programmatically access much of the console's functionality. Using these REST APIs, you can:

* Register new servers and manage existing servers, including restarting servers.
* Manage server groups.
* Access and manage files on servers.

== Assumptions

This section assumes that you have a clear picture of what xref:architecture-of-the-mule-management-console.adoc[What MMC is for] and that you have already xref:installing-mmc.adoc[Installed the Management Console] in your machine.
