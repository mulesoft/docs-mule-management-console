[WARNING]
Mule Management Console (MMC) was deprecated in December 2015. Its https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#mule-management-console[End of Life] is July 15, 2019. For more information see the xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mmc-migrator-tool.adoc[MMC Migrator Tool] or contact your Customer Success Manager to determine how you can migrate to Anypoint Runtime Manager.

The management console provides REST APIs that you can use to programmatically access much of the console's functionality. Using these REST APIs, you can:

* Register new servers and manage existing servers, including restarting servers.
* Manage server groups.
* Access and manage files on servers.

== Assumptions

This section assumes that you have a clear picture of the
xref:architecture-of-the-mule-management-console.adoc[Architecture of the Mule Management Console] and xref:installing-mmc.adoc[installed MMC]
