[WARNING]
Mule Management Console (MMC) was deprecated in December 2015. Its https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#mule-management-console[End of Life] is July 15, 2019. For more information see the xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/mmc-migrator-tool.adoc[MMC Migrator Tool] or contact your Customer Success Manager to determine how you can migrate to xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Manager].

Click the JMX tab to open a pane through which you can view all Mule-relevant JMX information. The pane displays the categories of JMX information (in a hierarchical tree format), such as JM implementation, Mule default, specific applications, and so forth. Click the arrow to the left of each category to expand the tree. See the figure below.
